                 WAR (Winning Above Replacement), provides a homogeneous metric for evaluating both pitchers and batters' performances at the same time. This statistic, along with with advanced performance variables such as wOBA and FIP, allow for us to gain a more accurate representation of the best players in Major League Baseball. These will be discussed in more detail below as we analyze players from the 2016-2017 MLB season. <span class='spacer'> </span> </span>   </h1> </div>

 <h3> wOBA is a solid indicator for overall offensive performance by a batter. It is meant to better the metric of On-base plus slugging (OPS), a popular sabermetric, by combining and taking into account all aspects of hitting and weighting them in proportion to their actual run value. 
If you look at the top graph showing the wOBA values for each player, you can see that a lot of players who rank top in the wOBA value also happened to be a top MVP candidate. Therefore, we can see that top-ranking batters tend to have high wOBA values too. Try clicking on a bar or searching up a player on the barchart to see where they stand on HR vs. WAR chart! </h3> <br> <br> <br>

<h3> WAR: WAR stand for Wins Above Replacement. As Fangraphs states, it attempts to “summarize a player’s total contributions to their team in one statistic”, expressing the value as the amount of Wins they contributed to their team.  We use Fangraphs’ formula for this, which takes sabermetrics representing different aspects in batting and pitching, such as fielding, batting, overall league performance. 
Exact formula for batters: https://bit.ly/2Q7p1LF
Exact formula for pitchers: https://bit.ly/2OTbFho
WAR  should be used as a guide for separating groups of players, and not as an exact estimate. It's hard to distinguish a 6.4 WAR player with 6.1 WAR player using WAR, but WAR can show with high level of confidence that a 6.4 WAR player and 4.1 WAR player are different in their values to quite an extent! </h3>
